#### Ideas
- use booster pack as controller/joystick for Google Earth flight sim
  - can control pitch and roll
- output text to 128x32 screen on booster pack?
  - status messages / input mode indicator?
- flight simulator with arbitrary planet atmosphere settings (see: https://what-if.xkcd.com/30/)
- orbital simulator
